The package has the necessary codes to spawn up a turtlebot in the simulation and cover a given field. Other packages and libraries like Fields2Cover, GracefulController, Ublox_driver (for ROS), turtlebot (for robot model) were used. Another controller package (Regulater_pure_pursuit_controller) has been tried out.
